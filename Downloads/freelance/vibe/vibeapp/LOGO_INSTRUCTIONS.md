# Logo Instructions

## Required Logo File

To complete the setup, you need to add a logo file:

**File:** `assets/images/logostart.png`
**Size:** 150x150 pixels (recommended)
**Format:** PNG with transparent background

## Current Status

The app currently uses a placeholder icon when the logo file is not found. The splash screen will display:
- A circular container with the VIBE icon (volume_up) as fallback
- Gradient background with animations
- "VIBE" text with "Visual Interactive Experience" subtitle

## Features Implemented

✅ **Splash Screen**

## Next Steps

1. Replace `assets/images/logostart.png` with your actual logo
2. Test the app functionality
3. Customize colors and animations as needed
4. Add more content and features

## Running the App

```bash

The app will start with a splash screen, then navigate to the main layout with persistent bottom navigation.
