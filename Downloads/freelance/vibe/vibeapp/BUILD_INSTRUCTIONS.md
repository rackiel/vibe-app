# VIBE App - APK Build Instructions

This document explains how to build APK files for the VIBE (Visual Interactive Experience) app using GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Method 1: Automatic Build (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Check GitHub Actions**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on "Actions" tab
   - You'll see the build workflow running
   - Wait for it to complete (usually 5-10 minutes)

3. **Download APK**:
   - Once complete, go to the "Artifacts" section
   - Download the APK file(s) you need:
     - `debug-apk`: For testing
     - `release-apk`: For production

### Method 2: Manual Trigger

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Select "Build Flutter APK" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Choose build type and click "Run workflow"

## üì± APK Types

- **Debug APK**: For development and testing
- **Release APK**: For production use (optimized)
- **Profile APK**: For performance testing

## üîß Workflow Features

### Basic Workflow (`build.yml`)
- Builds both debug and release APKs
- Runs tests automatically
- Uploads APKs as artifacts
- Creates GitHub releases for main branch

### Advanced Workflow (`build-advanced.yml`)
- Builds all three APK types (debug, release, profile)
- Code analysis and test coverage
- Matrix strategy for parallel builds
- Enhanced release notes

## üìã Prerequisites

- GitHub repository (public or private)
- Flutter code pushed to repository
- No local Android SDK required!

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Modify Build Settings
Edit `.github/workflows/build.yml` to:
- Change Flutter version
- Add signing keys
- Modify build commands
- Add additional platforms

### Add Signing (Optional)
To sign APKs for Play Store:

1. Add secrets to GitHub repository:
   - `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
   - `KEY_ALIAS`
   - `KEY_PASSWORD`
   - `KEYSTORE_BASE64` (base64 encoded keystore file)

2. Uncomment signing section in workflow

## üìä Monitoring

- Check build status in GitHub Actions
- View logs for debugging
- Download artifacts when ready
- Monitor release notes

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails**: Check Flutter version compatibility
2. **Tests fail**: Fix failing tests before building
3. **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are in `pubspec.yaml`

### Getting Help:
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Review Flutter documentation
- Check repository issues

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Wait for first build to complete
3. Download and test your APK
4. Share with users or upload to Play Store

**Note**: This method builds APKs in the cloud, so you don't need Android SDK installed locally!
